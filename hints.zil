	"Introduction to the hints"
	<PLTABLE "What are InvisiClues?"
		 "The essence of all interactive fiction is solving problems.
The purpose of InvisiClues is to maximize your enjoyment of the story by
giving you only the hints you need to continue and complete the story.
The hints generally progress from a gentle nudge in the right direction to a
full answer. The questions have been worded to give away as little as
possible. You should not use the presence or absence of a question on a
certain topic as an indication of importance. Included are dummy questions
and answers in order to minimize the problem.">
	<PLTABLE "How to use the InvisiClues."
		 "If you are stuck at some point in Wishbringer, find the
question that most pertains to your problem. Follow the directions above.
If you're still stumped, go on to the next hint.">
	<PLTABLE "What's the plural of \"platypus\"?"
		 "Platypuses."
		 "Platypi."
		 "Both platypuses and platypi are correct.">
	<PLTABLE "More info."
		  "Once you've finished the story, try the things in the \"For
Your Amusement\" section. Don't look at them before you've finished, though --
they may reveal the answers to certain problems.">
	"The beginning of the story"
	<PLTABLE "Somebody's calling me. What do I do?"
		 "The Post Office door may give you a clue. EXAMINE it."
		 "Since the door is open, why not GO INSIDE and see who's calling?">
	<PLTABLE "Where is the Magick Stone?"
		 "That's for us to know, and for you to find out.">
	<PLTABLE "Who is Mr. Crisp?"
		 "He's your mean old boss."
		 "And he isn't very happy about your idle daydreaming."
		 "So you'd better do what he says.">
	<PLTABLE "When should I open the envelope?"
		 "The story will tell you. Patience!">
	<PLTABLE "How do I get into the cemetery?"
		 "WALK INTO THE CEMETERY."
		 "You're not going to be scared away, are you?"
		 "Go on, chicken! WALK INTO THE CEMETERY and answer YES to the
question.">
	<PLTABLE "Who is the gravedigger?"
		 "LOOK AT THE GRAVEDIGGER and find out.">
	<PLTABLE "Can I get the flowers in the hearse?"
		 "Did you find the vase?"
		 "It may be hidden amongst the flowers in the hearse." 
		 "There aren't any flowers in the hearse."
		 "There's no hearse or vase, either."
		 "Remember the warning in the introduction: Don't let the
presence or absence of questions influence the way you play."> 
	<PLTABLE "What should I do with the umbrella?"
		 "It might come in handy if it rains."
		 "You can't WISH FOR RAIN unless you have an umbrella."
		 "So maybe you should hold onto it for later.">
	<PLTABLE "How do I get thru the locked gate?"
		 "The gravedigger has the only key to the gate."
		 "But the gravedigger is nowhere to be seen."
		 "You can't unlock the gate. To leave the cemetery, you must go
out through the open gate at Creepy Corner."> 
	<PLTABLE "The dog won't let me in the cottage!"
		 "It wouldn't be much of a watchdog if it did, would it?">
	<PLTABLE "The poodle let me go north. Why?"
		 "It doesn't like people walking past the cottage."
		 "It doesn't like mail clerks."
		 "It doesn't like you."> 
	<PLTABLE "How do I get past the poodle?"
		 "I wouldn't PICK UP THE POODLE THEN KICK IT if I were you."
		 "Since violence doesn't work, maybe bribery will."  
		 "You'll have to find something to bribe it with."
		 "Have you been to every location you can visit without getting
past the poodle?"
		 "Have you looked all around the cemetery?"
		 "Have you investigated the open grave in the Spooky Copse?"
		 "The gravedigger won't let you into the grave while he's watching."
		 "Wait until the gravedigger goes away. Then GO INTO THE OPEN
GRAVE. PICK UP THE OLD BONE. Bring it to the poodle and FEED THE BONE TO
THE POODLE. Now you can GO NORTH into the village.">
	<PLTABLE "Help! I left the envelope behind!"
 		 "You're not a very good mail clerk, are you?"
		 "There's no way to walk past the poodle once it has finished
eating the bone."
		 "So you'll have to start all over again."
		 "RESTART. Next time, hold on to that envelope!">
        "Festeron, past the poodle"  
	<PLTABLE "Who is Miss Voss?"
		 "She's in charge of the Festeron Town Library, curator of the
Festeron Historical Museum, and author of the best-selling \"Local History
Series\" of booklets, including The Legend of Wishbringer."
		 "Aren't you glad you asked?">
	<PLTABLE "Miss Voss give me my library card!"
		 "She doesn't like mail clerks."
		 "She doesn't like you."
		 "What library card?">
	<PLTABLE "What do I do with the violet note?"
		 "Miss Voss asked you to give it to your boss, Mr. Crisp."
		 "But delivering the mysterious envelope is more important
right now."
		 "So give the note to Mr. Crisp after you deliver the envelope.">
	<PLTABLE "Who is \"Corky\"?"
		 "It might be the name of Miss Voss's poodle."
		 "But why would Miss Voss write a note to her dog?"
		 "Since Miss Voss asked you to give the note to Mr. Crisp,
and the note is addressed to \"Corky,\" it's probably Mr. Crisp's nickname.">
	<PLTABLE "How do I get inside the Library?"
		 "Miss Voss probably has the key."
		 "Unfortunately, Miss Voss isn't around any more."
		 "You don't have time to fool around with the Library right
now. The Magick Shoppe closes at five o'clock!"
		 "Be patient; maybe you can get inside after you deliver the
envelope.">
	<PLTABLE "Who is Sgt. MacGuffin?"
		 "He's in charge of Festeron's Police Department.">
	<PLTABLE "How do I get the chocolate?"
		 "Simply TAKE THE CHOCOLATE OFF THE DESK."
		 "Of course, Sgt. MacGuffin might have other ideas."
		 "Have you tried examining Sgt. MacGuffin?"
		 "Wait until Sgt. MacGuffin falls asleep before taking the
chocolate.">
	<PLTABLE "What should I do in the Park?"
		 "The statue in the middle of the fountain is interesting."
		 "But not as interesting as the other objects in the fountain."
		 "LOOK INSIDE THE FOUNTAIN."
		 "The rest is up to you.">
	<PLTABLE "How do I catch the goldfish?"
		 "Unfortunately, you won't find a net or pole anywhere."
		 "What makes you think you have to catch the goldfish?">
	<PLTABLE "How do I get in the movie theater?"
		 "The schedule might give you a hint."
		 "The theater opens at seven o'clock. Come back later."> 
	<PLTABLE "Can I get things from the mailbox?"
		 "No. Public mailboxes are built to discourage prying fingers
like yours.">
	<PLTABLE "How do I play the video game?"
		 "By scoring as many points as you can."
		 "Naturally, you'll have to put a token in the video machine
before you can play."
		 "Isn't it getting awfully close to five o'clock?">
	"Festeron, continued" 
	<PLTABLE "What do I do with the seahorse?"
		 "If you don't do something quickly, it will probably die."
		 "A seahorse can't live long out of water."
		 "PICK UP THE SEAHORSE THEN THROW IT INTO THE BAY.">
	<PLTABLE "What happened to the church mouse?"
		 "It ran away when it saw you. Surprised?">
	<PLTABLE "How do I get the candle?"
		 "Try to TAKE THE CANDLE."
		 "Try to STEAL THE CANDLE."
		 "Taking things that don't belong to you is stealing,
especially in a church."
		 "At the moment, you can't steal the candle.">
	<PLTABLE "What should I do with the leaves?"
		 "Did you notice the message in the sand near the leaves?"
		 "Are you going to do what the message says?"
		 "You might be sorry if you don't.">
	<PLTABLE "Who wrote the message in the sand?"
		 "The person who wrote the message was obviously very
concerned that somebody like you might come along and disturb the pile of
leaves. Aside from this acute observation, the author of the message is not
important.">
	<PLTABLE "How do I get to Misty Island?"
		 "If you had a bathing suit you could put it on and swim over."
		 "No bathing suit, eh? Oh, well. You'll just have to wait for
the Misty Island ferry."
		 "Charter a private seaplane, preferably one equipped with a
wet bar and jacuzzi."
		 "If all else fails, give up."
		 "But watch for new opportunities after you deliver the envelope."> 
	<PLTABLE "What do I do with the horseshoe?"
		 "Keep it. It might bring you good luck."
		 "Especially if you use it to WISH FOR LUCK after you find the
Magick Stone.">
	<PLTABLE "How do I get into the lighthouse?"
		 "It's a phoney lighthouse. You can't go into it."
		 "Ever."
	         "So stop trying.">
	<PLTABLE "What should I feed to the pelican?"
		 "A flapping, juicy fish would be nice if you can find one."
		 "The only fish you'll find is in the fountain."
		 "Unfortunately, you can't get the fish in the fountain."
		 "What makes you think the pelican is hungry?">
	<PLTABLE "Can I enter the impenetrable forest?"
		 "Look up the word \"impenetrable\" in a dictionary.">
	<PLTABLE "What can I do with the gnarled tree?"
		 "You can always CLIMB THE GNARLED TREE."
		 "Maybe you should have examined the tree first.">
	<PLTABLE "What can I do with the dead branch?"
		 "It probably won't help you deliver the envelope any faster."
		 "But it's a good idea to remember where it is. You might
find a use for it later.">
	<PLTABLE "Mr. Crisp fired me! What did I do?"
		 "You failed to deliver the envelope on time, or didn't read
it to the old woman. Next time, make sure you're in the Magick Shoppe before
five o'clock, and do what the old woman asks you to do!">
	"Ye Olde Magick Shoppe"
	<PLTABLE "Why is \"Magick\" spelled with a \"k\"?"
		 "Because."
		 "Oh, all right. \"Magick\" is an archaic spelling popularized
by Aleister Crowley (a 20th century occultist) and occasionally seen in pulp
fantasies and tales of horror. It's supposed to imply an especially old and
potent variety of supernatural force.">
	<PLTABLE "How do I get into the Magick Shoppe?"
		 "Just OPEN THE DOOR THEN GO INSIDE.">
	<PLTABLE "Can I reopen the door the wind shut?"
		 "You can't open it by yourself."
		 "Relax. Maybe somebody will come along and open it for you.">
	<PLTABLE "How can I take the birthday cards?"
		 "By removing them from the glass case."
		 "Unfortunately, you can't reach into the glass case."
		 "So you can't take the naughty birthday cards."
		 "You rascal."> 
	<PLTABLE "Why can't I approach the curtain?"
		 "Maybe it doesn't like mail clerks."
		 "It's enchanted in such a way as to discourage nosey visitors.">
	<PLTABLE "Who is the old woman?"
		 "She's the proprietor of the Magick Shoppe."
		 "The mysterious envelope is addressed to her."
		 "So maybe you ought to give her the mysterious envelope.">
	<PLTABLE "Why did the Shoppe become quiet?"
		 "A noise stopped."
		 "A nearby mechanism stopped working."
		 "EXAMINE THE GRANDFATHER CLOCK."
		 "The clock stopped when the old woman appeared. Creepy,
isn't it?">
	<PLTABLE "The clock stopped. Is it a bug?"
		 "It's not a bug. See the previous question for details."
		 "If it was a bug, you could blame it on one of the Infopeople
who playtested the game. In alphabetical order, they are: \"Hollywood\" Dave
Anderson, Joanne Avtges, Gary Brennan, Amy Briggs, Mark \"Max\" Buxton, Liz
Cyr-Jones, Suzanne Frank, Jeff O'Neill, plus dozens of beta- and gamma-testers
too numerous to list.">
	<PLTABLE "Who is \"The Evil One?\""
		 "She's the person who mailed the mysterious envelope."
		 "She kidnapped the old woman's pet cat, and is demanding
a Magick Stone for ransom."
		 "If she doesn't get the Stone before the moon sets, she'll
probably do something awful to the cat."
		 "Doesn't sound like a very nice person, does she?">
	<PLTABLE "What should I do with the metal can?"
		 "Like all objects in the story, you should EXAMINE it."
		 "The rest is up to you.">
	<PLTABLE "Why does the metal can rattle?"
		 "Maybe there are some yummy mixed nuts inside." 
		 "Then again, maybe not."
		 "There's something built into the can that makes it rattle."
		 "It's designed to lure innocent victims to their doom by
making them believe there may be nuts inside.">
	<PLTABLE "Why can't I move?"
		 "The old woman is casting a subtle hypnotic spell on you."
		 "So shut up and pay attention.">
	<PLTABLE "Who is \"Chaos\"?"
		 "It's the name of the old woman's pet cat."
		 "It's also the name of Dan Horn's pet skunk.">
	<PLTABLE "Who is Dan Horn?"
		 "He's the owner of a pet skunk named Chaos."
		 "He used to work at Infocom."
		 "He paid $10.00 to see his name in print."
		 "(This space for sale.)">
	<PLTABLE "My status line just went crazy!"
		 "It's not a bug."
		 "It's a feature."
		 "It's the sort of thing that happens in Magick Shoppes.">
	"After the Magick Shoppe"
	<PLTABLE "What's up? Festeron changed!"
		 "Exactly."
		 "The village seems to have come under an evil, supernatural
influence."
		 "The influence's initials are T.E.O."
		 "The \"T\" stands for \"The,\" and the \"O\" stands
for \"One.\""
		 "Sorry. You have to figure out the \"E\" yourself.">
	<PLTABLE "Where is the stone, Wishbringer?"
		 "It may be a lot closer than you think."
		 "It seems odd that the old woman didn't simply give it to you,
doesn't it?"
		 "Maybe the old woman gave it to you without telling you."
		 "Have you noticed a persistent rattling sound?"
		 "Have you investigated the metal can since you left the Magick Shoppe?"
		 "Have you looked inside the metal can?"
		 "OPEN THE METAL CAN. SQUEEZE IT."> 
	<PLTABLE "Where is the Evil One?"
		 "Don't worry. She'll find you.">
	<PLTABLE "Who is Thermofax?"
		 "He's a fire-breathing dragon mentioned in The Legend of
Wishbringer and the opening title screen.">
	<PLTABLE "Thermofax won't leave me alone!"
		 "Throw the Magick Stone into his open maw."
		 "If that doesn't work, throw yourself into his open maw."
		 "Except for brief mentions in The Legend of Wishbringer and
the opening title screen, Thermofax does not appear in the story.">
	<PLTABLE "How do I get down the steep trail?"
		 "Use the map you drew on your way up the trail."
		 "You did take the story's advice when it told you to draw
a map, didn't you?"
		 "If you forgot to draw a map, you can still feel your way down
the steep trail. But it won't be easy. And you might die trying."
		 "There's another, safer way to get down the trail without a
map."
		 "You'll need the Magick Stone."
		 "One of the Seven Wishes can clear the fog away."
		 "If you're holding Wishbringer and an open umbrella, you can
WISH FOR RAIN. The resulting downpour will clear the fog and transport you
to the bottom of the cliff.">
	<PLTABLE "What's the vulture doing?"
		 "It's watching you."
		 "Doesn't that make you uneasy?"
		 "It ought to. The vulture is the Evil One's spy.">
	<PLTABLE "How do I get past the toll gate?"
		 "Why not just pay the troll?"
		 "The troll won't take your gold coin? Gee. Tough luck."
		 "Maybe there's something else you can give the troll."
		 "What about the metal can?"
		 "Troll still bothering you? This just isn't your lucky day." 
		 "There are three ways to get past the troll."
		 "Two of the ways involve using the Magick Stone."
		 "The other way doesn't."
		 "The troll may or may not bother to examine your gold coin."
		 "If you're lucky, he won't examine it."
		 "If you're holding Wishbringer and the horseshoe, and you
WISH FOR LUCK before giving the coin to the troll, the troll won't bother
to examine the coin."
		 "Another way past the troll is to WISH FOR DARKNESS. It will
scare him away just as thoroughly as the snake."
		 "You can't WISH FOR DARKNESS until you've found the grue's milk."
		 "You won't find the milk until after you get past the troll."
		 "Using the Darkness Wish to get past the troll is only
useful if you have to go past him twice."
		 "If you've already released the snake, you'll have to use Magick."
		 "The non-Magick way is to give the closed metal can to the troll, or to open it in front of him. The snake will scare him away.">
        "Witchville"
	<PLTABLE "What's the giant stump for?"
		 "It affords an excellent view of the surrounding area."
		 "Have you examined it lately?"
		 "OPEN THE STUMP. Surprise!">
	<PLTABLE "What is a grue?"
		 "The grue is a sinister, lurking presence in the dark places
of the earth. Its favorite diet is Adventurers, but its insatiable appetite
is tempered only by its fear of light. No grue has ever been seen by the
light of day, and few have survived its fearsome jaws to tell the tale.">
	<PLTABLE "How do you milk a grue?"
		 "Very carefully."
		 "Fortunately, you don't have to milk a grue to finish the story.">
	<PLTABLE "Where do I find the grue's milk?"
		 "Grue's milk must be kept in a cool, well-lighted place to
stay spoiled."
		 "Grue refrigerators are cool and well-lighted."
		 "There's a grue refrigerator in the Grue's Nest.">
	<PLTABLE "How do I safely get the grue's milk?"
		 "Avoid waking up the beast with light or noise."
		 "The light source you're carrying is waking up the beast."
		 "Cover the beast so it can't see." 
		 "Blankets make an excellent cover."
		 "Get the blanket in the Jail Cell. COVER THE BEAST WITH
THE BLANKET before it wakes up.">
	<PLTABLE "How do I get around in the dark?"
		 "You'll need a source of light."
		 "Have you found the small stone yet?"
		 "Have you examined it?"
		 "There's another, more conventional source of light."
		 "It's in the church."
		 "Go into the church and STEAL THE CANDLE.">
	<PLTABLE "Why can't I blow out the candle?"
		 "It's magic."
		 "It's Magick.">
	<PLTABLE "What is the Boot Patrol?"
		 "Stay in one place for a while. You'll find out.">
	<PLTABLE "How do I get out from the jail?"
		 "Maybe you're not the first person who's tried to escape."
		 "Have you investigated everything in the Jail Cell?"
		 "Have you looked under everything?"
		 "LOOK UNDER THE BUNK."
		 "If this is the first time you've been thrown in jail, just
MOVE THE BUNK THEN GO INTO THE HOLE."
		 "If not, you'll find that the hole has been cemented over.
Now you'll need Magick to get out of the Jail Cell."
		 "One of the Seven Wishes might work."
		 "EAT THE CHOCOLATE THEN WISH FOR FREEDOM."
		 "If you don't have the chocolate or Wishbringer handy, relax.
The Boot Patrol will be along in just a few moves, and all your troubles will be over.">
	<PLTABLE "How do I get rid of the big mailbox?"
		 "Give it what it wants."
		 "Give it mail."
		 "Give it stamped mail."
		 "There's another mailbox with some stamped mail in it."
		 "Find a shimmering trail."
		 "The shimmering trail is at the Rocky Path."
		 "OPEN THE SMALL MAILBOX. TAKE THE LEAFLET OUT OF THE BOX.
Go to the big mailbox and FEED THE LEAFLET TO THE BIG MAILBOX."
		 "Congratulations. You have a new companion.">
	<PLTABLE "The small mailbox follow me! Why?"
		 "It likes mail clerks."
		 "It likes you.">
	<PLTABLE "How do I get through the Cemetery?"
		 "Did somebody warn you about going in there after dark?"
		 "You can't get through the Cemetery. It's a trap.">
	<PLTABLE "What is an eldritch vapor?"
		 "Any relation to Eldridge Cleaver?"
		 "They're mischievous but generally harmless ghosts that hang
around cemeteries at night, annoying passersby with supernatural tricks.">
	<PLTABLE "Help! The vapors stole everything!"
		 "Have you looked around the village?"
		 "Everywhere?"
		 "The vapors will scatter your possessions randomly around the
village, always outdoors. Pesty little critters, aren't they?">
	<PLTABLE "How can I get past the hellhound?"
		 "Maybe you can bribe the hellhound the same way you bribed
the poodle."
		 "Then again, maybe not."
		 "There are three ways to get past the hellhound."
		 "One of them involves Magick."
		 "One of the Seven Wishes might help you."
		 "WISH FOR DARKNESS while standing outside the cottage. The
hellhound will cower in fear long enough for you to get past."
		 "Another way involves the video game in the arcade."
		 "Refer to the arcade hints for instructions on how to
play the video game."
		 "The last way to get past the hellhound only works if you've
already been inside the Tower."
		 "Have you read all of the mail in the story?"
		 "Have you read the violet note?"
		 "You can't open the violet note yourself."
		 "Wait until Mr. Crisp opens the violet note. After he leaves,
read the note."
		 "Then go to the hellhound and say ALEXIS, HEEL. The hellhound
will become considerably less ferocious.">
        "Platypuses (or is it Platypi?)"
	<PLTABLE "What's inside the pit?"
		 "Maybe you should LOOK INSIDE THE PIT."
		 "If you found a platypus, congratulations."
		 "If not, you must have disturbed the pile of leaves that used
to cover the pit. Shame on you!"
		 "You can't possibly finish the story if you disturbed that
pile of leaves."
		 "RESTART. Next time, heed the message in the sand!">
	<PLTABLE "What is a platypus?"
		 "Look it up in an encyclopedia."
		 "A platypus has webbed feet, a flat tail, dense fur, and a
bill that looks like a duck's bill."
		 "Amazing, aren't they?">
	<PLTABLE "What do I do with the platypus?"
		 "Maybe you don't have to do anything with it."
		 "Unless you want to finish the story."
		 "It'd be really nice if you rescued the platypus."
		 "Not as easy as it sounds, eh?"
		 "There are two ways to rescue the platypus."
		 "One of them involves the use of Magick."
		 "Platypuses are great swimmers."
		 "If you filled the pit with water, the platypus might be
smart enough to swim out."
		 "One of the Seven Wishes might help you fill the pit with water."
		 "While standing at Edge of Lake, OPEN THE UMBRELLA THEN
WISH FOR RAIN."
		 "If you don't have the umbrella or Wishbringer, or if you've
already used the Rain Wish, you'll have to find another way to rescue the platypus."
		 "How deep is the pit?"
		 "There's something you can get that might help you reach into the pit."
		 "Did you notice the dead branch at Cliff Bottom?"
		 "PUT THE BRANCH IN THE PIT. The platypus will hold on to the end of the branch. PULL THE BRANCH OUT OF THE PIT.">
	<PLTABLE "Why are there so many platypuses?"
		 "That's what our marketing department wanted to know."
		 "But we wouldn't explain it to them."

suggest it?) try to BLOW THE WHISTLE."

EXAMINE THE WHISTLE. Then take the whistle to the place where you found it,
and EXAMINE THE WHISTLE again."

just like to hear the music.">

		 "The first way into the theater involves the use of Magick."
		 "Go into the theater lobby and WISH FOR DARKNESS. You can
sneak inside while the gravedigger is stumbling around in the dark."

TICKET TO THE GRAVEDIGGER. GO INTO THE THEATER.">

dropped a pair somewhere."

Then EXAMINE THE STAR."

you're satisfied, PUSH THE BIG RED BUTTON."

		 "The first switch controls the power in the Palace Theater.
(If you watched the entire movie, you'd already know this.)"

Hmm. Wonder what the Evil One wants to keep secure ..."

	"The Library"
	<PLTABLE "How do I get into the Library?"
		 "Wait until Miss Voss opens it tomorrow morning."
		 "Unfortunately, you haven't got time to wait. Looks like
you'll have to unlock the front door somehow."
		 "Miss Voss locked it earlier. Maybe she put the key somewhere."

		 "It's easy to get into the cottage once you tame the
hellhound. (But that's another hint.)"
		 "The key to the Library is on Miss Voss's bookcase.">
	<PLTABLE "How can I see in the Library?"
		 "The candle is a source of light."
		 "Too bad the candle fizzles out when the Library door closes."

But there is another way to see in the Library."
		 "Have you examined the wizard's hat?"
		 "Have you looked inside the wizard's hat?"
                 "Have you dropped anything inside the wizard's hat?"
		 "Things you drop into the wizard's hat disappear. But they
might turn up someplace else."

		 "DROP THE CANDLE INTO THE WIZARD'S HAT before it gets blown
out. You can later retrieve the candle for use as a source of light.">
	<PLTABLE "Where's the circulation desk key?"

		 "Then again, why should a door key work in a desk?"
		 "There is no desk key. You can't open the circulation desk.">
	<PLTABLE "Can I get the spider in the books?"
		 "You'll have to pick up the books first."

use the broom, the umbrella, the conch shell, the bottle or the dead branch."

breaking it."

something awful!"

before she interrupted."

	"The Seven Wishes"
	<PLTABLE "What Advice do I get from the shell?"
		 "There are seven bits of Advice. In order of appearance, they are:"
		 "1. \"If ye hath not kept a Map, only patience or Magick can help thee.\""
		 "2. \"Magick may help thee cross the Bridge.\""
		 "3. \"Release a Prisoner, and be Rewarded.\""
		 "4. \"Learn the Word of Power, else never gain the Tower.\""

		 "7. \"Fit the Pieces together, and the Puzzle is complete.\"">
	<PLTABLE "Where is WISH FOR RAIN useful?"
		 "If you're lost in the fog, wishing for Rain will wash you
safely down to the Cliff Bottom."
		 "If you're at Edge of Lake, wishing for Rain will fill the
narrow pit with water and free any creatures that may be trapped there." 
		 "Wishing for Rain anywhere else is harmless, but the downpour
might irritate nearby characters.">
	<PLTABLE "When should I WISH FOR FLIGHT?"
		 "Whenever you want to go back to the Magick Shoppe. Just make
sure you're outdoors (or in the Laboratory), and off you go!"
		 "It's not a good idea to go back to the Magick Shoppe until
you've found Chaos, the old woman's black cat."
		 "Make sure the black cat you've found is the right one."
		 "If you locate the real Chaos, you won't need to WISH FOR FLIGHT."
		 "So you'll never need to WISH FOR FLIGHT. It's a trap.">
	<PLTABLE "Why do I want to WISH FOR DARKNESS?"
		 "Some characters might not like the sudden Darkness."
		 "One of them is the troll at the toll gate."
		 "If you WISH FOR DARKNESS with the troll present, he'll run
away across the bridge."
		 "The gravedigger is afraid of the dark, too."
		 "If you WISH FOR DARKNESS in the Theater Lobby, you may be
able to sneak past the terrified gravedigger into the theater. (Not a very
good movie usher, is he?)"
		 "There's one other creature who doesn't like Darkness."
		 "It's the hellhound."  
		 "If you WISH FOR DARKNESS at Outside Cottage, the hellhound
will cower in fear long enough for you to sneak past.">
	<PLTABLE "What's the WISH FOR FORESIGHT?"
		 "You get a tantalizing, heavily symbolic glimpse of the
future, all mixed up with snippets of the past and present."
		 "Don't worry about what it means." 
		 "It's a dream sequence.">
	<PLTABLE "Why didn't the WISH FOR MAGICK work?"
		 "You weren't holding Wishbringer."
		 "You weren't holding the Magick Wand."
		 "You didn't wave the Magick Wand over the Magick Rutabaga."
		 "Magick Wand? Magick Rutabaga? WISH FOR MAGICK?">
	<PLTABLE "Why should I WISH FOR LUCK?"
		 "Luck gives you all sorts of little benefits that make it
easier to finish the story."
		 "There are five ways the WISH FOR LUCK can help you."
		 "The five ways are:"
		 "1. If you're Lucky, the troll won't notice that your gold
coin is a \"counterfeit.\""
		 "2. If you scare the troll away by wishing for Darkness,
he'll drop your gold coin on the bridge ... but only if you're Lucky."
		 "3. Normally, the eldritch vapors in the cemetery will carry
you away and scatter all your possessions once they've taken a good look at
you. But if you're Lucky, they'll steal your possessions, one at a time,
before they carry you away." 
		 "4. The hellhound will eat you up if you hang around for more
than three moves. But if you're Lucky, it'll just keep roaring at you."
		 "5. Your chances of being eaten by a grue in the dark are
much lower if you're Lucky.">
	<PLTABLE "Why was my Luck Wish neutralized?"
		 "Next time, avoid opening the umbrella indoors or walking
under the ladder. These are very Unlucky things to do.">
	<PLTABLE "Where should I WISH FOR FREEDOM?"
		 "It only works in two situations."
		 "If you're thrown in jail more than once, the only way out
is to WISH FOR FREEDOM. You'll usually end up on Lookout Hill (unless the
Boot Patrol is there, in which case the Stone will thoughtfully deposit you
outside the Police Station)."
		 "You can also free yourself from the chains in the Torture
Chamber with a WISH FOR FREEDOM."
		 "Just make sure Mr. Crisp isn't there when you try it.">
